This includes reservoirs built for private irrigation projects which, nonetheless, have served as sources of public water- supply for communities in the direst situations. Reservoirs that supply public irrigation projects in the Northeast region often provide water supply for human and animal consumption in situations of water scarcity. Upon coming into effect, the Law for Protection of Native Vegetation ushers in a massive process of restoration of APPs and reforestation of riverbanks, with the aim of preventing silting of water bodies and improving drainage in river basins. A review of the legislation covering construction of small and medium-size dams and measures to cut through the bureaucracy for obtaining water-storage, water production, and water use rights is needed.

Removal of fats, oils and greases; Reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD); Settling out of solids; Treatment and conditioning of the sludge produced in the process to make them suitable for their intended use andor disposal, and Polishing the water (treat, filter, deionize, disinfect and condition) to a standard suitable for its intended re-use With a view to maximizing the climate change mitigation and overall environmental benefits of the industrial process, and simultaneously strengthening the economic viability of the Pilot Project, the proposed industrial and investment process was based on three stages: Stage 1: two to four pre-treatment lines to reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the effluent and precipitate out sludge.",1,3069

They estimate that 11% of net primary production is sequestered (with 25% and 75% quartile ranges of this estimate being 4-17% sequestration). Kelp Blue�s projected NPP at full scale is 241,000 tonC/year, so low to medium estimates of sequestration from a natural stand of this size would be 9,665 � 27,411 TgC/year. This does not consider emissions associated to operations though.

The growth area in seaweed fertilizers is in the production of liquid seaweed extracts. These can be produced in concentrated form for dilution by the user. Several can be applied directly onto plants or they can watered in, around the root areas. There have been several scientific studies that prove these products can be effective. In 1991, it was estimated that about 10 000 tonnes of wet seaweed were used to make 1 000 tonnes of seaweed extracts with a value of US$ 5 million. However, the market has probably doubled in the last decade because of the wider recognition of the usefulness of the products and the increasing popularity of organic farming, where they are especially effective in the growing of vegetables and some fruits",1,3432
