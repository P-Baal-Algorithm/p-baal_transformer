Various UN organizations, INGOs and NGOs have been implementing potable water supply projects across Myanmar to improve living conditions in remote areas. After the devastation of Cyclone Nargis (2008), a number of international aid agencies (e.g. Munich Re Foundation, Arche Nova, Aktion Deutschland Hilft), local organisations and volunteers focussed on restoring drinking water by cleaning and repairing wells in NUMBER villages (Kungyangon and Amar districts) and providing toolkits, pumps and plastic sheeting (1m catching NUMBER litres rainwaterday). The World Health Organisation, in collaboration with the Norwegian Government, donated four large and twenty small Portable Water Purification Systems. Training for staff within the Myaung Mya Township hospital was provided for installing and using the purification systems. Examples of technologies that have previously been used in rural water supply projects include: shallow tube-wells with hand pumps, deep tube-wells with tara pumps, deep tube-wells with India Mark ii pumps, gravity fed systems, improved hand dug wells and rainwater collection jars.

The wells are drying up and the population in some villages are walking long distance to fetch water. Small holder irrigated agriculture from ground water is failing examples are like in Alla and Hagaz are depending on water tracking. Rural inhabitants are paying more than double the price they use to pay costal areas groundwater sources are threatened with seawater intrusion. So far, no projects have been implemented whose main objective is to enhance ground water volumes as coping mechanizes strategies have not been effective. In Eritrea, about one million cubic meters of water flow out of the country as surface flow. If a substantial amount of this water is allowed to be stored in under ground aquifer as ground water, this will enable communities and livelihood resource to better adapt to the negative impact of climate changes.
