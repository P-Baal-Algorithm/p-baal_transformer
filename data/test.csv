Despite  this  higher  than  global  average  figure,  the  timing  of  the rainfall  suggests  that water supply  for various purposes  could only be guaranteed  for six months  only,  unless  steps  are  taken  to  collect  and  store  the  available  water.   There is increasing  realization  that surface water systems are too expensive  to manage,  especially so when  treatment  is unavoidable.   The sustainability of surface  water  systems  is under serious threat  due  to  lack  of  investment,   exacerbated   by  climate  change.    There  is therefore the need to maximize  the collection,  storage, and use of available  precipitation by  adopting more  efficient   and  affordable   technologies.
