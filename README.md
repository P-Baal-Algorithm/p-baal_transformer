# P-BAAL Algorithm
This repository implemets P-BAAL algorithm to develop ESG scoring relating to Rio Marker Score.

To develop the algorithm, we utilised as a base code a training function for transformer-based models developped by HuggigFace, which was further extended to incorporate adapters and active learning designs.
